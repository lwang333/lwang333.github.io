<div id="research">

  <div id="case-study-desc">Read-It-Again is a secondhand bookstore local to the city I grew up in. They're known for their family-oriented practices and ability to trade-in as well as purchase used books. They host events frequently for all age groups and genres and also host several clubs for their customers to engage with.

    <p>This project was assigned through the UX Academy of Design Lab, in which I was responsible for research, UX/UI design, and asset creation.</p>

  <h2>Goals & Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a responsive website that is easy to use and that allows customers to browse and shop online (e-commerce) while also providing store details such as events, clubs, trading-in, general policies, and shop updates (a blog) in an organized manner.</li>
      <li>Give their current site a more modern and organized update without losing it's home-made feeling.</li> 
    </ul>

   <div id="extra-desc"> 
     <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>This project spanned <b>two weeks</b>, in which I worked alone and acted as the <b>user experience researcher</b> and the <b>user interface designer</b>.</p>

  <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Pinpointing a Persona</h2>
      <p>In order to find the best way to organize Read-It-Again's website, I took a look at several competitors' websites. Then, to create a persona that best suited Read-It-Again's audience, I conduced interviews with individuals who had traded their possessions in and/or participated in secondhand shopping.</p>

  <div id="define">
    <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Defining the Details</h2>
      <p>To determine what to build out for the wireframes and eventual prototype, I created a sitemap and user flows. These assets also helped to better inform the preliminary organization of the website.  </p>

     <h2>Site Architecture</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>Had I not been on such a strict timeline, I would have conducted a card sort to see how users might have organized the site. Unfortunately, given the time constraint, I used patterns I noticed when comparing competitors' websites in the earlier Research phase to create the sitemap. This step proved to have an effect on the user testing phase later down the line.</p><p>I first began by listing the major pages of the website and attempted categorizing them with a mindmap. I refined the mindmap before realizing this information was best delivered in a venn diagram.</p>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>With the sitemap and flows complete, I moved onto wireframing the site. I built out the desktop site first before building the mobile and tablet sites. I focused on creating pages relevant to the user and task flows.</p>

     <p>To facilitate the creation of the prototype, I made a UI kit.</p>

    <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Testing the Prototype</h2>
      <p>After finishing the prototype, I reached out through several platforms to find participants for the user test. A test plan was created and was summarized in my findings as well, which I condensed for the purposes of this case study:</p>

        <div id="case-study-p">
          <p>To organize the results and find patterns that would inform what tweaks to make to iterations, I made an affinity map of the participants' comments.</p>

  <div id="next">
        <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>Given the time crunch, new iterations of the prototype with further user testing could not be performed. If I'd had more time, the next steps would have been:
            <ul>
              <li>Correct the prototype so that it included "Trade-in" as its own tab,</li>
              <li>Have the Cart module pop-up when "Add to Cart" is selected,</li>
              <li>Flesh out the Calendar pages,</li>
              <li>Add connections to footer navigation,</li>
              <li>and conduct further user tests. 
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      <div id="case-study-desc">
        <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
      </div>
        <div id="case-study-p">
          <p>Prototyping took the longest (a total of 20 hours) due to the huge number of screens and connections. I had to stop early in order to meet deadlines. In the future, number of screens needs to be taken into account when forming the project timeline.</p> 

          <p>User recruiting, interviewing, and testing took the second-longest, which was not unexpected.</p>
