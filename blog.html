   <h2>Post #7 (5.8.20)</h2>
   <p>A lot has happened!!!</p>
   <p> 
    <ul>
      <li>I finished my SquareSpace portfolio a while ago, actually, I just haven't gotten around to posting that here, hahaha.</li>
      <li>I got furloughed.</li>
      <li>I joined a UX design bootcamp. I have to take the intro course to qualify for the UX course, but the intro course is just four weeks on design basics and I currently have nothing but time. I asked if I could expedite my process so that I could join the earlier cohort (May 18th instead of June 22nd) and was told I could, I just have to do all four weeks before May 16th. I'm currently on track. </li>
      <li>I bought an iPad Pro. Alright, this isn't really progress, it's just something I've wanted for a while for drawing and now I can check it off, LOL.</li>
      <li>I'm very seriously considering getting a Master's in HCI.</li>
    </ul>
  <p>I think that's it for now. I find that if I don't keep myself busy, I fall into emotional turmoil, so I've been hyper-productive, which I know is the opposite of what a lot of people are experiencing right now. Times are interesting right now and human experience is amazingly broad.

   <h2>Post #6 (4.16.20)</h2>
   <p>It's been a while since I actually did this (I did this before the shelter-in-place for COVID-19 in GA started), but I bought a temporary site on Squarespace for my portfolio while I design it.</p>
   <p>I've also downloaded Sketch (and signed up on InVision), but I've yet to use it.</p>
   <p>I'm still updating my Squarespace portfolio, but that should be done soon. I've started a lot of personal projects recently, due to being at home all the time.</p>

   <h2>Post #5 (3.11.20)</h2>
   <p>I spiffed up the home page and fixed the hover-transition for the links. I also added an about me page. Removed the serif'd font and also fixed the widths of my boxes (literally. I made them fixed-width bc they were doing that thing where they crowd the sides of the page when the browser-size shrinks).</p>
   <p>I'm having difficulty specifying the hover-transition to only be for the links when hovered over. When I refresh the page, I can see the entire divs fading in.</p>
   <p>I'm extremely pleased with my header. I'm also extremely pleased with my "about me" section, but I wonder if it comes off like I really like talking about myself. Which I do. But it's okay bc I really like having other people telling me all about themselves as well. </p>
   <p>Eventually I'd like to:
    <ul>
      <li>Make my name change colors with every refresh,</li>
      <li>Add a photo-timeline-history thing on my about me section,</li>
      <li>and make the last sentence in my about me section look more like the pagetitle element. This is the easiest one on the list since I know how to do it, but that also makes me want to put it off bc I'm in the mood to explore.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Apart from this website though, I also updated my resume and at some point today, I need to add more assets to my portfolio on tumblr. I'm a little intimidated of coding a portfolio onto this website, but when I pick apart the process, all I really have to do is sketch some page designs and work-displays I'd like.</p>

   <h2>Post #4 (2.23.20)</h2>
   <p>I added a homepage and navigation. </p>

   <h2>Post #3 (2.22.20)</h2>
   <p>I mostly just reviewed CSS today. Working on this website has gotten me a little ahead of the curve, but I did also learn new things today. I learned about :root and I learned about variables in CSS (I had to google why they were important, but once I understood, my mind was blown), I also learned about media queries.</p>
   	<p>The entire next section in FreeCodeCamp is going to be basically be design/color theory, which I think is hilarious as a graphic designer. They have a section for complementary colors and color theory!!! hahahaha aaaah. I feel like I am extremely lucky to be coming into this with the background I have.</p>
   	<p>I'm excited to move forward. I do have bouts of apprehension though, as the portfolio website I dream of creating is extremely complicated and I really wonder how long it will take. But I'm gradually understanding this stuff, and coding is very fun!</p>
   	<p>No updates to the website today bc mostly I reviewed. None of the new information I learned really applies to my website yet (it's too basic to make mobile-friendly; it's already mobile-friendly right now).</p>

   <h2>Post #2 (2.21.20)</h2>
   <p>I figured out a little bit of really basic CSS (HTML I'm pretty far along, but this class/id/span/etc stuff is confusing me and I definitely need to do more of it), so right now I'm testing out if I can create separate blog posts or if this is all going to mess up.</p>
   <p>I just looked up how to code date/time of publish for a post, and it goes into JavaScript and PHP, which is all stuff I haven't touched at all yet O___O so for now, these posts will have no moment of publish. It's gonna be okay though because in a short time, I'll be posting updated shots with my posts, hehehe.</p>

  <div id="blogpost">
   <h2>Post #1 (2.20.20)</h2>
   <p>I'm going to learn to create websites from scratch. I am also gonna learn UX. Once I learn all that, I'm going to get myself a good domain name because right now, "lwang333" is the name I used when I played neopets as a kid, which is coincidentally where I first learned to do basic coding.</p>
