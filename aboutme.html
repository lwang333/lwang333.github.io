  <div id="aboutme">
    I graduated in 2017 with a BFA in Graphic Design from the University of Georgia. I worked in-house for a few years but wanted to make more (pun intended) so anytime I wasn’t working, I developed my front-end skills while also learning UX from scratch.

    <p>I like reading. I like movies. I like music theatre. I like bullet journals. I like watching people make things (food, woodwork, interior design, their faces, anything). I like video games (especially ones with pixel graphics). I’m hoping to eventually stick my nose into some game dev.</p>

<p>I'm a sucker for couture. I’d like to learn to sew and then wedge my way into that design-sphere. My backup plan is to do layout/copy design and find my way to Vogue.</p>

<p>I am a (really friendly, kind, patient) control-freak. I organize my time, my money, my living-space, my work, and my personal life with an attention-to-detail that borders on obsession. I am a planner, and I believe it makes me a better designer.</p>

<p>I’m saving up for a Tesla; if I didn’t care about sustainability, I’d save for a Rolls-Royce (one with those LED stars on the ceiling). I never have more than 65 articles of non-pajama clothing in my closet. I don’t understand why America hasn’t adopted bidets. My least sustainable habit is how much I enjoy eating out. I will always get the cake or cookies in the breakroom with you.</p>

<p>I am convinced we will figure out instant teleportation. Not while I’m alive, but definitely in the future.</p>

<p>I’m a firm believer in the idea that creating physical plans produces actual results. And if you can’t already tell, I dream big.</p>
