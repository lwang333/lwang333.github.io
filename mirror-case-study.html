<div id="research">

  <div id="case-study-desc">Mirror is an affordable brick-and-mortar clothing retailer for anyone looking for trendy clothes. With the rise of online shopping, they wanted to create their own online shopping experience to take advantage of the huge opportunity for sales as well as clear out the remaining inventory in their warehouses.

    <p>This project was assigned through the UX Academy of Design Lab, in which I was responsible for research, UX/UI design, and asset creation.</p>

  <h2>Goals & Objectives</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Design a responsive e-commerce website that is easy to use and that allows customers to browse through all products and filters by size, color, style, and other.</li>
      <li>Create a new visual identity for the company that is modern and neutral enough to attract all types of people and styles.</li> 
    </ul>

   <div id="extra-desc"> 
     <h2>The Basics</h2>
      <p>This project spanned <b>one month</b>, in which I worked alone and acted as the <b>user experience researcher</b> and the <b>user interface designer</b>.</p>

  <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Pinpointing a Persona</h2>
      <p>In order to determine the persona that best captured the overall qualities of Mirror's customer-base, I conducted interviews and analyzed competitors with three goals in mind:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li>Understand why people shop online as opposed to in-store (and vice versa) and empathize with those people.</li>
          <li>Demographic of online clothing shopping in general.</li>
          <li>Understand what makes Mirror popular and how to translate that when moving online.</li>
        </ol>
      <p>I believed that the best methods to achieve these goals were:</p> 
        <ol>
          <li><b>Secondary Research</b> to find existing knowledge of the current market;</li> 
          <li><b>Competitor Analysis</b> to determine relevant audiences from competitors to facilitate interviews, to better understand the current market, and to consider the existing successes and pain points within e-commerce;</li>
          <li>and <b>User Interviews</b> to discover what users like about Mirror and how they feel about online shopping in general.</li>
        </ol>

  <div id="define">
    <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Defining the Details</h2>
      <p>Then, to determine what to build out for the wireframes and prototypes, I conducted a card sort that would give me a look into how others' might organize an e-commerce site, a site map to establish site architecture, task flows to provide clarity for essential pages, and a user flow in the persona's POV to see how to appeal specifically to the user-base.  </p> 
    </div>

      <div id="case-study-desc">
        <h2>Project Goals</h2>
      </div>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>By determining the interests of every party involved and where they intersect, features in the wireframe could be traced back to how that feature might help, enhance, or even hinder goals. To do this, I created a venn diagram. </p>

    </div>

    <div id="case-study-desc">
     <h2>Site Architecture</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>I conducted the card sort with 5 participants and was met with surprising insights. Based on those insights and the general sorting pattern, I created the site map.</p>

      <h2>Task and User Flows</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="case-study-p">
      <p>The card sorting and resulting site map gave me a rudimentary idea of what navigating the site might look like. I created the task flows and user flows based on those general impressions.</p>

      <div id="case-study-desc">
        <h2>Wireframing</h2>
      </div>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>With the basics built out, I moved on to wireframing. Before creating digital lo-fi renderings of Mirror, I sketched a few wireframes of competitor's sites so that I could get a feel for what made for an enjoyable, immersive experience and what didn't. As the goal was to give myself a rough idea of what worked and didn't work, I didn't let sketching take longer than five minutes per drawing.</p>
      <img src="img/mirror/wf-sketch.png" width=100% alt="Lo-fi sketches of competitor's sites." title="Lo-fi sketches of the competitor's sites."></img>

      <p>Because the assignment was to build out a prototype including the three most important pages of the site, I made the product listings and product page when creating higher fidelity wireframes. I included annotations to indicate any  micro-interactions that couldn't be included in the wireframes.</p>
        <img src="img/mirror/homepage.png" class="wireframe" width=36% alt="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the homepage for Mirror." title="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the homepage for Mirror."></img>
        <img src="img/mirror/product-listing.png" class="wireframe" width=29.05% alt="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the product-listing for Mirror." title="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the product listing for Mirror."></img>
        <img src="img/mirror/product-details.png" class="wireframe" width=28.2% alt="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the product detail page for Mirror." title="Hi-fidelity wireframe of the product detail page for Mirror."></img>

      <p>I created responsive UIs for each of these page when I was creating the high-fidelity prototype.</p>

        <h2>UI Kit & Branding</h2>
    </div>

    <div id="case-study-p">
     <p>Because one of the goals was to give Mirror a new visual identity alongside its e-commerce debut, I created a new logo and style guide that also informed the UI for the project.</p>

        <h2>Prototype</h2>

    </div>

  </div>

  <div id="testing">
    <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Testing the Prototype</h2>
      <p>With the prototype built out, I approached several more individuals with experience shopping online to test the model. My goal was to evaluate and understand pain points and sources of confusion for users when navigating the website, with the ultimate goal being conversion. Due to COVID-19, I conducted interviews remotely with the screen-recording function of a testing website (Maze) while video-conferencing with the participant in question.</p>

        <h2>Affinity Map</h2>
      </div>
        <div id="case-study-p">
          <p>To organize the results and find patterns that would inform what tweaks to make to iterations, I made an affinity map of the participants' comments.</p>

  <div id="next">
        <div id="case-study-p"><h2>Next Steps</h2>
          <p>The assignment ended after discussing hand-off tools, but in a real-life application, these are the things that would happen next:
            <ul>
              <li>Further refining and testing of the prototype.</li>
              <li>Hand-off to developers.</li> 
            </ul>
          </p>
        </div>
      <div id="case-study-desc">
        <h2>Key Takeaways:</h2>
      </div>
        <div id="case-study-p">
          <p>There were some things that couldn't be helped given the global circumstances and the academic nature of the assignment (things like number of participants or interview accessibility). I felt throughout the project that my interview/test results could have better informed my decisions throughout the entire process, so I recognize now the value of dedicating massive amounts of time to interviewing and testing during the research processes.</p>
